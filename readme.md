1. Problem Statement
	- The goal of this game was to get players to be engaged in the game for a minimum duration of 5 mins.
	- The game is meant to be played multiple times to allow some replayability, and to get players to solve riddles that provides a sense of accomplishment when they complete the game.

2. Technologies / Skills
	- Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript (DOM)
	- Skills: Creating a mood/setting, items, unlockables, clues and hints

3. Approach
	- Research games within the scope of the unit
	- Narrowed down to story-based or RPG-based games
	- Planning structure for level 1
	- Write the code using technologies above
	- Testing the code, adding visual/audio elements to enhance user-experience
	- Upload project on Github

4. What I learnt
	- A lot of code in multiple sections are re-usable, so re-factoring the code once in a while will be helpful to ensure a more clean & efficient code.
	- Plan how many stages/levels before starting to code.
	- CSS is important to ensure game looks professionally-done.
	- User-feedback is crucial to improving the app. Having multiple people test the game allows revision and improves overall user-experience.
	- Committing more and having structure when committing will be useful later on when referencing what has been done.
